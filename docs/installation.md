## Prerequisites

Follow these steps to set up UO Landscaper Mod:

1. Ensure **UO Landscaper** is already installed on your system. The mod requires an existing installation to function. You can still get it from [Ultima Online World](https://uo.wzk.cz/uolandscaper/) or the [ServUO Community](https://www.servuo.com/archive/uo-landscaper-v1-4-x.380/).
2. Verify that you have administrator privileges, as these are required for installation.

## Steps to Install

1. Download the Installer

- Obtain the latest version of the **UO Landscaper Mod** installer executable from the official repository.

2. Run the Installer

- If prompted, allow the installer to run with administrator privileges.

3. Select UO Landscaper Directory

- During installation, the wizard will ask you to select the folder where **UO Landscaper** is installed. This ensures the mod - integrates with the correct files.

4. Confirm Installation Directory

- Choose the installation directory for the mod. Ensure it is separate from the **UO Landscaper** directory to avoid conflicts.
  The default location is pre-filled, but you can adjust it if needed.

5. Complete the Installation

- The installer will copy the necessary files to the selected mod directory and integrate them with the existing UO Landscaper files.
- If any files are missing from your **UO Landscaper** installation, the installer will notify you.

## Post-Installation

1. Uninstallation

- This installer does not support automatic uninstallation. To remove the mod, delete the installed files manually.

## Troubleshooting

- **Error: "No UO Landscaper directory selected"**

  - Ensure you select the correct directory where **UO Landscaper** is installed.

- **Error: "The UO Landscaper directory cannot be the same as the installation directory for the mod"**

  - Select a separate directory for installing the mod to prevent overwriting important files.

- **Error: "Some files may not have copied successfully, but installation will continue"**
  - If some files fail to copy, check your UO Landscaper directory for missing components. Reinstall UO Landscaper if necessary and retry the mod installation.
