{: .note }
This mod includes only the XML files used by UO Landscaper. UO Landscaperâ€™s source code and binaries are not part of the package.

**UO Landscaper Mod** aims to enhance the Ultima Online mapping tool, **UO Landscaper**, by offering a complete and reliable collection of transition and random statics tables for all map tiles in the classic [Ultima Online](https://uo.com) (Time of Legends) client.

While this mod arrives fashionably about two decades too late, it serves as a testament to the lasting legacy of Ultima Online and its active Free Shard community.
